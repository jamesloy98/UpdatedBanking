## Project title
The title of this application is Banking Application. It is a mock up of a banking application that keeps track of three accounts:
Checking, Savings and Loan as well as a customer.

## Motivation
This project was created for a class project. It initially only kept track of checking and saving deposits and withdrawals.
I reworked the application so it now can deal with loans and user login. I was inspired from an ATM for the user interface. I also figured it was important to have an easily understandable interface.

## Screenshots
Include logo/demo screenshot etc.

## Tech/framework used
Ex. -

<b>Built with</b>
- [Electron](https://electron.atom.io)

## Features
Some included features are:
Login for users that connects to a database that includes encryption.
An easily understandable user interface.
An arraylist of transactions that keep track of each transaction from each account.
Date and time stamps for important events.

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation
To properly run this application, my AWS database will have to be active to be able to access the login portion for users.
